# Blackjack Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Blackjack card game. The game is played between a player and the dealer (computer).

## Game Rules

1. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.
2. Each player is dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt two cards with one card face up and one card face down.
3. The player can choose to "hit" to take another card or "stand" to keep their current total.
4. If the player goes over 21, they "bust" and lose the game.
5. Once the player stands, the dealer reveals their face-down card and hits until their total is 17 or higher.
6. The player wins if their total is higher than the dealer's without busting, or if the dealer busts.
